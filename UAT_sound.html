<!--                        Fernando Diaz Avila's Assignment
    What do I need to have?;
        I need to add sound, and creat the table to display the info required.

    Planning:
       I will review my notes in looking how to add sound as I remeber learning there is an audio tag, and play audio
       functions.

    What can I do to improve for next time?
        I wnat to automatically play once the user logs in can make the site look more
        of a countdown by adding more elements.

    <!--I can enxure that the function will keep looping by adding a while loop statment for each if 
        statment witht the same condition until its met. It worked when there was only while loop statement.
        So I tried fitting them all into 1 while statement with every condition from each if statement and that didn't do anything
